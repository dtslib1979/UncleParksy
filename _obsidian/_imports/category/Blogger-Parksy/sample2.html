📘 Parksy Automation OS Whitepaper

— A one-person creative factory system built with LLM × GitHub × Mobile × MCP (final version)

One-line keyword summary  
Speech → Structuring → Code/Action → Build → Publishing → Loop

1. Starting Point: “I want to get to systems just by talking”

1-1. The First Shock: The Code-Generation Power of LLMs

It began very simply.

“I just ask, and it writes all the code for me?”

Beyond text answers, it can produce:

Python scripts  
Web code  
Architecture explanations  
Even full automation flows

From here, a basic desire was born:

“If I can speak, and that speech can chain into code, documents, factories, and publishing all at once, isn’t that enough to build a whole system?”

This became the seed of the Parksy OS / EduArt Engineer project.

1-2. The Second Shock: Claude MCP Desktop = Remote Machine Supervisor for PC

If ChatGPT replaces the “head,” then Claude MCP bolts on the “hands + muscle + factory robots.”

It can:

Read/write local files  
Execute ffmpeg  
Run Python code  
Install/build Node projects  
Automate git commit/push  
Generate/reshape folder structures  
Even build APKs

From this came the conclusion:

“The PC is no longer the computer I operate with my own hands.  
It is an automated factory that Claude drives on my behalf.”

1-3. The Third Discovery: GitHub = Publisher + Core Code Factory

I stopped seeing GitHub as “just storage,” and started seeing it like this:

Content repository: MDX, HTML, images, data  
Publisher: GitHub Pages  
Build/deployment system: GitHub Actions  
Template/standardization center: repo structures

In short:

“GitHub = The HQ & publishing house & core code factory of my entire ecosystem.”

This shift in perception is the core of the current system.

2. The Walls I Hit in the Middle (Failures and Confusion)

2-1. The Attempt to “Do Everything on Mobile”

Initial goal:

Replace InShot on the phone  
Run PWAs on the phone  
Use GitHub from the phone  
Do almost all editing/publishing on the phone

But reality was:

Bulk ffmpeg processing → Unrealistic on mobile  
Node/Python/Docker builds → Practically require a PC  
MCP (local control) → Doesn’t work well from mobile  
APK build/debugging → PC environment is far more suitable

Key realization:

“The phone is the center, but heavy factory work requires the PC.”  
I had to accept this.

2-2. Where the Plan to Replace InShot with a PWA Broke

Initial plan:

“Instead of repetitive editing in InShot, I’ll build a cloud InShot using Vercel + PWA.”

Problems:

Vercel serverless functions have strict time limits  
Hobby / Free: a few seconds  
Pro: even then, around 60 seconds  
Video encoding, long ffmpeg jobs → constant timeout risk

No direct access to phone internal storage  
You must upload files to process them

Conclusion:

❌ Long videos, massive editing, or direct, zero-upload access to phone-local files are beyond what a PWA/Vercel combo alone can support.

2-3. The Confusion: GitHub / Vercel / Domains / PWA

At one point, the state looked like this:

GitHub Pages  
Vercel  
Tistory / WordPress / custom domains  
Separate PWA repo  
Separate Apps repo

All of these were mixed together without clear intuition, and it was confusing.

Now:

Domain roles are separated (parksy.kr / eae.kr / dtslib.com)  
Seven repo slots are fixed  
GitOps-based structure is mostly cleaned up

This whitepaper assumes that “cleaned” state as the baseline.

3. Final Recognition: Clearly Defining Roles

Core keyword: “Who runs what, where, and how?”

We can divide things along four axes:

1) Devices

Phone  
PC

2) Platforms

GitHub  
Vercel  
YouTube / social media

3) AI Agents

ChatGPT  
Claude MCP  
Grok  
GitHub Copilot Agents

4) Artifacts (Outputs)

MDX / HTML / web pages  
PWA / APK  
Video / audio / images  
Whitepapers / tutorials / teaching material

4. Precise Role Definitions

4-1. Phone (Galaxy / Mobile) = Main Console + Production/Consumption Terminal

What the phone does:

Throw speech via STT (Samsung keyboard)  
Send speech to ChatGPT → planning / design / structuring

Via GitHub app or web:

Do simple edits to code/MDX/HTML  
Monitor Actions and retry when needed  
Manage branches/commits (at a simple level)  
Check Vercel dashboards  
Install/test PWAs  
Upload to YouTube/Instagram/Threads  
Directly use final artifacts (finished videos/pages/apps)

Key:

“The phone is the king. It issues commands, reviews results, publishes, and consumes.”

4-2. PC + Claude MCP Desktop = Heavy Industry Plant + Operating Room

On the PC, Claude MCP does:

Run Python/ffmpeg automation scripts  
Design and run the factory: MIDI → AIVA → audio → merged videos  
Clone GitHub repos locally → perform large-scale refactors  
Install/build/test Node/Next.js apps  
Build APKs (React Native / Flutter etc.)  
Generate yml templates for GitHub Actions

DevOps-level automation:

CI/CD pipelines  
Batch image/video conversions  
Large-scale batch jobs orchestration

In summary:

“The PC is the factory, and Claude is the surgeon factory chief.”  
The human (Parksy) stands above that, doing concept work and issuing directives.

4-3. GitHub = HQ + Publisher + GitOps Hub

GitHub’s roles:

1) Content repository

MDX, HTML, JSON, images, metadata

2) Publisher (GitHub Pages)

MDX/HTML edits → Actions → build → immediate reflection  
Core backbone of parksy.kr / eae.kr / dtslib.com

3) Automation hub (Actions)

Commit → build → test → deploy  
All workflows for Pages, Vercel, and others are triggered here

4) Template/standard structure

Seven fixed repo slots  
Shared boilerplates  
PWA/MDX/tutorial templates

One important point:

GitHub Actions can be edited/triggered sufficiently from mobile (I already use it that way).  
However, reproducing the environment locally (e.g., via act) and handling big builds/debugging is way more stable on PC + Claude.

4-4. Vercel = Studio for Apps, Utilities, and Lightweight Backends

What Vercel does:

Deploy Next.js-based PWAs/web apps  
Serve simple API routes  
Optimize images and static files  
Auto-build/deploy when GitHub commits land

(Heavy tasks like video encoding ❌ should be moved to background workers or other services.)

From Parksy’s perspective:

“Vercel is the studio that releases GitHub-based apps into the world.”  
“The PWAs used on the phone are built and hosted here.”

4-5. PWA = Cloud App Running on the Phone

Summary:

Installed on the phone  
Executed on the phone  
Data mostly lives in the cloud (GitHub / DB / S3, etc.)  
Sits between browser and native app

Proper roles for PWAs:

Upload-based automation

Select/upload files from the phone  
Server processes them  
Downloads the results back

View/edit interfaces

Browse GitHub-based content  
Light input forms/data entry  
Tagging/classification/notes

Things you should absolutely not force on a PWA:

Scanning the entire local storage of the phone  
Lengthy video encoding with ffmpeg  
Long-running batch processing

Those belong to the PC or APK layer, not the PWA.

4-6. APK = True On-Device Factory App to Replace InShot

Strengths of APKs (Android apps):

Can access /storage/emulated/0/... folders (with permissions)  
Scan local galleries, Music, Download folders, etc.  
Use libraries like ffmpeg-kit to encode directly on the phone  
Can work offline

You can basically build “an editor that looks like InShot but runs my logic.”

Role:

“When you want to process videos/audio already stored locally on the phone, without any upload, APK is the answer.”

Therefore, summary:

InShot replacement ≈ APK, not PWA.  
PWA = “upload-based automation.”  
APK = “local-based automation.”

4-7. AI Team: Roles Are Fixed

🧠 ChatGPT = Brain / Design / Structuring / Writing & Layout

Pipeline:

Parksy’s speech → concept clarification → structuring → whitepapers/tutorials  
Drafts GitHub README / MDX / design docs  
Generates prompt engines, project guidelines, and architecture documents  
Transforms “thought” into “system design blueprints”

🧬 Claude MCP = Surgeon / Automation Factory Chief

Runs Python/ffmpeg/Node/Docker/Git directly on the PC  
Handles batch jobs, large-scale refactors, environment setup, debugging  
Responsible for APK builds, local testing, and GitHub integrated batch work

🎭 Grok = Memes / Campaigns / Trend Scanner

Handles MZ-style copy, Shorts captions, and campaign lines  
Spits out short, high-impact messages in Twitter-style language  
Asks, “How do we sell this in current internet slang?”

🧰 GitHub Copilot Agents = Editorial Part-timers for Publications

Inside GitHub repos, they:

Edit MDX  
Tweak CSS/design  
Restructure categories  
Clean up import paths  
Remove dead links  
Do minor code refactors

In other words, the “part-time editorial team” that keeps GitHub Pages publications tidy day by day.

5. Overall Flow: “Speech → GitOps → Publishing → Distribution”

5-1. Base Loop (Content / Whitepapers / Tutorials)

1) Speak

Talk via STT on the phone → send into a ChatGPT thread

2) ChatGPT structures

Clarifies concepts  
Slices into sections  
Turns it into tables/structures  
Adapts it into an MDX template

3) It goes into GitHub

Stored as MDX/Markdown/HTML  
Committed and pushed

4) GitHub Actions run

Build starts  
If errors appear, I check logs → fix → rebuild

5) Published to GitHub Pages / Vercel

Exposed to the world as web pages/apps

6) Copilot Agents polish, if needed

Adjust styles/design/categories/links

7) Final consumption & sharing from the phone

Check via browser/PWA on phone  
If needed, re-share to YouTube/Instagram/Threads/blog

5-2. Video/Audio/Shorts Loop (InShot Replacement Line)

1) Collect sources

Download MIDI (PC or phone)  
Use already created image/video units (phone/cloud)

2) PC + Claude factory

Python + ffmpeg factory (e.g., 120 tracks)  
Apply rules:

Match audio with video  
Generate individual clips  
Concatenate longer versions

3) Deliver results

To GitHub, Google Drive, S3, etc.  
Or copy directly onto the phone

4) Use them via Phone/APK/PWA

APK: recombine local clips, do extra editing  
PWA: upload-based cloud editing (light use cases)  
Upload to YouTube Shorts/long-form

Core idea:

Long & heavy processes = PC + Claude factory  
Shorts-level combination/distribution = phone & APK & PWA & YouTube

6. What This Whole System Means

6-1. Technical Meaning

GitOps-based one-person creative factory  
Clear device split: Phone (command/consumption) vs PC (factory)  
AI team orchestration:

ChatGPT (design)  
Claude (execution)  
Copilot (editing)  
Grok (campaigns)

Clarified roles of PWA vs APK  
Upload-based vs local-based automation

6-2. Creative/Business Meaning

InShot-type editing labor → replaced by systems  
Whitepapers, tutorials, world-building, webtoons, Shorts are all wrapped into:

“Speech → Structuring → Code/Action → Publishing”

It’s a one-person company, but in reality:

CTO (Claude)  
CCO/Planner (ChatGPT)  
Marketing team (Grok)  
Editorial department (Copilot)

The structure is similar to a small full-stack company.

7. Final Three Principles (Parksy Automation OS Core Principles)

1) If you speak, it is recorded.

STT → LLM → GitHub  
Even rough speech is structured by the system.

2) If it is recorded, it gets built.

GitHub commit → Actions → build → publishing  
The human only pushes buttons and chooses direction when errors occur.

3) If it is built, it gets published.

Pages / PWA / APK / YouTube / social media  
The results automatically spread across multiple channels.
