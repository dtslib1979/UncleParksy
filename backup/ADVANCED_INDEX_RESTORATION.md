# Advanced Category Index Files Restoration

## What Was Restored

- Professional papyrus-style theming
- Interactive search and filtering
- Pagination controls
- Multiple view modes (Ledger, Cards/Scrolls)
- Proper metadata display (dates, tags, file types)
- Responsive design
- JavaScript functionality

## Files Restored
- blog-transformation/index.html (428 lines)
- device-chronicles/index.html (430 lines)  
- system-configuration/index.html (431 lines)
- thought-archaeology/index.html (417 lines)
- webappsbook-codex/index.html (428 lines)

## Script Protection
Modified `scripts/generate_category_index.py` to preserve these advanced index files and only update `assets/home.json` for category counts.

## Backup Location
Simple index files backed up to: `backup/simple-index-files/category/`
